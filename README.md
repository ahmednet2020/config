# typescript-config-with-grunt
The problem is the typescript import and export moduel not work in old browser[IE]
to solve this problem iam use browserify 
it is convert the es6 import moduel to require moduel
work in browser that's all grunt and browserify 
do in this config 
and sure babel if typescript miss something in convert to es5
